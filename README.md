# ChatGPT-like Large Language Model (LLM)

Welcome to my ChatGPT-like LLM project! ðŸ¤–âœ¨  
This repository features my implementation and experiments in building conversational AI using transformer-based large language models.

## ðŸ“š Overview

- **Goal:**  
  To create an advanced, conversational AI model capable of generating human-like text in response to user queries.
- **Technologies Used:**  
  - Python  
  - [Add frameworks/libraries: e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers]
- **Key Components:**  
  - Transformer architecture  
  - Pre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs  
  - Conversational inference scripts and hosting  
  - Prompt engineering and customization
